Uncertainty analysis
1. Run a BTC inversion (either regularized or not, either user-defined path or automatic multiple paths)
2. Import the inverted parameter set for which the uncertainty is to be assessed, and re-run the transport model
3. If previously used, remove the regularization option in the Pest general settings
3. Set up and run a new "user-defined path" inversion
4. Run the post-calibration uncertainty analysis
